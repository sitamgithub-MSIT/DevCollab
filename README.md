## Introduction

DevCollab is a forum-like web application that enables developers to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other. It allows beginners to learn from experienced developers and experienced ones to help others and share their knowledge.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application using their email address and password. It uses Django's built-in session-based authentication system.
- **User Profile**: Users can create and update profiles with their name, email address, bio, and profile picture.
- **Topics**: Users can create topics to discuss specific subjects, ask questions, and share information.
- **Categories**: Topics are organized into categories to help users find relevant discussions.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on topics to share thoughts, ask questions, and provide feedback.
- **Activity Feed**: Users can view an activity feed displaying recent topics, comments, and replies.
- **Search**: Users can search for topics, categories, and users using keywords.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly, adjusting the layout based on the device's screen size.
- **Admin Panel**: Administrators can manage users, topics, categories, and comments via the Django admin panel.
- **Serverless Deployment**: The application can be deployed using serverless functions on platforms such as Vercel.

## Technologies

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Libraries and Dependencies

- PyCharm/VS Code: IDE for writing code
- All required modules are listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python (v3.10 or compatible version)
- pip (latest version)
- PostgreSQL (or another preferred database)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitamgithub-MSIT/DevCollab.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd DevCollab`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. (Optional) Set up a PostgreSQL database:
   - Create the database
   - Update the database settings in `settings.py`
7. Run initial migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables as described in `env.example`. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the required variables. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your own. Here are some of the key variables you need to configure:

- `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for the Django project
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development, `False` for production

If you are using a different database, you will also need to set the following variables:

- `DB_NAME`: The name of the database to use
- `DB_USER`: The username for the database connection
- `DB_PASSWORD`: The password for the database connection
- `DB_NAME`: The name of the database to use
- `DB_HOST`: The hostname of the database server
- `DB_PORT`: The port number of the database server

You can also configure other Django settings in the `settings.py` file. Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/) for more information on the available settings.

## Usage

To start the development server, run `python manage.py runserver`. Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Running Tests

## Deployment

For deployment options, you can use Vercel as a serverless deployment platform. You can deploy the Django project using the Vercel Serverless Functions. The project is already set up to work with Vercel, so you can deploy it directly from the repository.

The files responsible for the deployment are:

- `vercel.json`: This file contains the configuration for the Vercel deployment. It specifies the routes and serverless functions to use for the deployment.
- `build_files.sh`: This script is used to build the project before deployment. It installs the dependencies and runs the collectstatic command to collect the static files.

Please refer to the Vercel documentation for more information on how to deploy a Django project using Vercel.
